### 🧠 About Mellinre

Mellinre is building the next layer of intelligence for businesses that want to move fast, think smarter, and automate everything that slows them down.  
Our tools connect data, decision-making, and automation in a single, AI-driven stack — so companies can go from idea to insight in real time.

We believe AI should feel less like a feature and more like infrastructure — something that quietly powers everything else you do.

### ⚙️ What We’re Building

- A unified platform for **AI workflows, automation, and integrations**.  
- APIs and SDKs that make it effortless to plug AI into any stack.  
- Scalable AI operations for **businesses, developers, and creators** who want intelligence that actually works in production.

### 🚀 Our Vision

We’re creating the foundation for the next generation of intelligent systems — from startups building smarter apps to enterprises transforming their operations.  
AI shouldn’t just predict; it should help you build, decide, and act. Mellinre exists to make that possible.
