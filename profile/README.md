### 🧠 About Mellinre

Mellinre is building the next layer of intelligence for businesses that want to move fast, think smarter, and automate everything that slows them down.  
Our platform unifies data, decision-making, and automation in one AI-driven stack — so companies can go from idea to insight in real time.

We believe AI should feel less like a feature and more like infrastructure — something that quietly powers everything else you do.

### ⚙️ What We’re Building

- A unified platform for **AI workflows, automation, and integrations**  
- APIs and SDKs that make it effortless to embed intelligence into any product  
- Scalable AI operations for **developers, startups, and enterprises**

### 🚀 Our Vision

We’re creating the foundation for the next generation of intelligent systems — from early-stage builders to large organizations reinventing how they work.  
AI shouldn’t just predict; it should help you **build, decide, and act**.  
Mellinre exists to make that possible.
