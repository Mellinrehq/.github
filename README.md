### 👋 Welcome
We’re building the missing layer between raw data and insight.  
Mellinre helps analysts, engineers, and fintech teams clean, structure, and protect data — fast.

---

### 💡 Why Mellinre
Data teams spend more than **70% of their time** wrangling and cleaning messy files.  
Errors, duplicates, and inconsistent formats don’t just waste time — they break models and decisions.  
Mellinre fixes that automatically, with privacy built in.

---

### ⚙️ What We’re Building
- **Developer-friendly API + SDKs** (Python & JavaScript)  
- **Smart transforms** for dates, currencies, phone numbers, duplicates, etc.  
- **Zero-knowledge encryption** so even we can’t read your raw data  
- **Reproducible changelogs** that document every transformation
